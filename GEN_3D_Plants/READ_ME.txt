>>> Run [main_final.py] to generate stereoMap.xml & depth map & mask & .ply files
>>> Use 'point clouds' folder for point clouds & mesh
>>> Add the generated .ply files to 'point clouds' folder

Notes:
>>> .ply files can be generated once and be used in other folders
>>> .xml file does not need to be used in other folders to use with .ply files

>>> IF other stereo data is used, ALWAYS run [main_final.py] again to generate new files
